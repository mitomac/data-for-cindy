# Loading Data from GitHub

This will import the Excel spreadsheets from github.

```
individual scattergram for dave.xlsx
indiviuals by week for dave.xlsx
```

The data will appear in the left sidebar in a directory called 'data-for-cindy'


## The Goal will be to recreate these plots 

(which I assume were made in Prism)
