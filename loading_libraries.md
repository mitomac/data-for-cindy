# Loading Libraries

The code begins by installing and then loading various R packages, each serving a specific purpose in data analysis and visualization.

- **Installing Additional Packages**:
  - `install.packages('ggprism')`: Installs the `ggprism` package, which provides Prism-like themes and color scales for ggplot2.
  - `install.packages('infer')`: Installs the `infer` package, which provides a modern approach to statistical inference.

- **Loading Libraries**:
  - `library(ggplot2)`: Loads the `ggplot2` package, a powerful tool for making complex and customizable plots in R.
  - `library(readxl)`: Loads the `readxl` package, which is used for reading Excel files into R.
  - `library(tidyverse)`: Loads the `tidyverse` suite of packages, which are designed for data science tasks including data manipulation (`dplyr`), data visualization (`ggplot2`), and data tidying (`tidyr`).
  - `library(repr)`: Loads the `repr` package for controlling the graphical representation of data (like plot size and resolution) in environments such as Jupyter notebooks.
  - `library(RColorBrewer)`: Loads the `RColorBrewer` package, which provides color palettes for designing attractive and informative graphics.
  - `library(IRdisplay)`: Loads the `IRdisplay` package, useful for displaying rich content types like HTML or images in Jupyter notebooks or other frontends.
  - `library('ggprism')`: Loads the `ggprism` package, enhancing ggplot2 with Prism-like themes and color scales for improved visualization aesthetics.
  - `library('infer')`: Loads the `infer` package, which offers a syntax for statistical inference that is consistent with the `tidyverse` approach to R programming.

This setup ensures that all necessary tools for data analysis, from reading data files to creating advanced visualizations, are available in the R environment.
